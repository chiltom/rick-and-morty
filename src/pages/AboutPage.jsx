          Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom
          that airs on Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of Rick
          Sanchez, a cynical mad scientist, and his good-hearted but fretful
          grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and
          interdimensional adventures that take place across an infinite number
          of realities, often traveling to other planets and dimensions through
          portals and on Rick&apos;s flying saucer.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-10 mt-3">
          The general concept of Rick and Morty relies on two conflicting
          scenarios: domestic family drama and a misanthropic grandfather
          dragging his grandson into hijinks.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-10 mt-3">
          The show consists of 7 seasons with each, besides the first,
          containing 10 episodes (the first season contained 11 episodes).
