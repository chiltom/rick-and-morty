# Rick and Morty API Fetcher

## About

This front-end portion of the application aims to grab character data from the Rick and Morty API
(https://rickandmortyapi.com) and make "cards" out of it for users to look at quick data about and
either see details or add the character to a favorites page.

## Further Goals:

Add an episodes and locations tab with data about different episodes and locations as well.
